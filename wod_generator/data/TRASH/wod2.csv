The other divisions only require a sign up!; With all these divisions, there is a place for everyone to compete!

We have never had the opportunity to go away as a gym, and this is a great first chance to do so!; Last year in the Elite division there were many games athletes! So not only will you get to see your fellow CFS members and coaches kick ass, but you will also see some big CrossFit names that you get to cheer on!; I am really excited about announcing this and I want to try to get as many people involved as possible! Let’s get CFS on the map and show Miami what our community is all about!! I will be making a group on Facebook where we can stay up to date with news and updates!; Please come to me with any questions, comments, or concerns!; https://www.the","link","http://www.findawod.com/apalooza_fitness_festival!_this_competition_featur"
