 Deadlift 225
 Handstand push-ups; This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management (work/rest timing to optimize time) is an essential skill.; If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk.

 Deadlift 225
 Handstand push-ups; This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. It’s expected that you’ll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management – work/rest timing to optimize time– is an essential skill.; If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk.

 Deadlift 225
 Handstand push-ups; This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. Compare your time to August 5, 2003 when we did a ""mini-Diane"" at 15-12-9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.; If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be ""your Diane.""; Post time and any needed modifications to comments."

Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.; If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk.

If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk.

"https://www.crossfit.com/workout/?page=163","Inman Mile; From the U.S. All-Round Weightlifting Association, USAWA: “The lifter will have loaded onto his/her shoulders a weight equal to 150% of bodyweight. The lifter will then carry the weight a distance of one mile. Gait is optional. Resting is allowed, but neither the lifter nor the weight may be supported. Records will be kept in both pounds and time. Should the weight be touched by any aide once the lift has begun, the event is terminated. The lifter may be handed refreshments during the lift.”; This is hard, and for many impossible. Start with 150% of bodyweight and see how far you can take it. Then, if not able to make the mile, rest and start again with largest load you estimate can be carried for a mile regardless of time. Post load, bodyweight, and time to comments."

It begins with a powerful whole body arch sending the ball behind the head with the back and hips hyperextending, then the athlete hurls the ball forward and overhead towards the target.

"https://www.crossfit.com/workout/?page=184","One Muscle-up per minute for as long as you can go!; Can anyone do one muscle-up per minute for twenty minutes?
 How far can you get?; Note:
 1. A muscle-up is pulling yourself from below the rings to above and
 dipping to full arm extension. It is an unrivaled move for developing
 upper body strength.
 It is much more difficult than any pull-up or dip and consequently a
 move of much greater potential for strength development.
 2. If you don't have rings, buy them!! Rings have no rival for upper
 body strength development. If you are serious about your sport/fitness
 you'll pick some up.
 3. We've listed some vendors within the message board.
 4. If you can't do a muscle up, see how many pull-ups and dips can
 you do in an hour?"
