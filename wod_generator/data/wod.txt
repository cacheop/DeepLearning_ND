Diane ; 21-15-9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand push-ups ; This is 3 rounds ; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management (work/rest timing to optimize time) is an essential skill. ; If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be "your Diane." ; Post time and any needed modifications to comments. ; Compare your time to 050201 .

Diane ; 21-15-9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand push-ups ; This is 3 rounds ; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill. ; If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk.

If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be "your Diane." ; Post time and any needed modifications to comments .

?I've believed ever since that living on the edge, living in and through your fear, is the summit of life, and that people who refuse to take that dare condemn themselves to a life of living death.? - John H.

For time: 50 Push-ups 50 Pull-ups 75 Sit-ups 75 Kettlebell Swings, 1 "pood" kettlebell (16kg) 150 Air Squats ; Perform in any order. The idea is to perform each in as few sets as possible. All of the reps from each exercise do not have to be completed before starting some from another exercise. Keep track of the reps and tally the total sets to completion. Note time to completion. Final score is total number of sets multiplied by time in minutes to completion. ; Notes: 1. One possible approach is to perform a near max set of push-ups, go on to the pull-ups, do the same with the sit-ups, etc. After the squats, go back to the push-ups and run through the list again finishing as much as you can at each exercise. 2. Seven sets total in ten minutes for a "70" is an excellent score! .

We've been putting the warm-up into the workouts so that everyone understands the importance of properly preparing for the work ahead. In doing this we have to sacrifice class time or class runs long. The idea here is for you all to take responsibility for your own bodies and warm up appropriately. SO.... today, and moving forward, the warm-up is written for you but it will NOT be a part of the class. Please try to get in and do it on your own before class begins. If not, the coaches have been instructed to move forward with class while you complete the warm-up. You may then jump in wherever the class has progressed to ; 3 mins Z1 .
