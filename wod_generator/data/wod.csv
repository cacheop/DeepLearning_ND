Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.; If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk.

Keep track of the reps and tally the total sets to completion.  Note time to completion. Final score is total number of sets  multiplied by time in minutes to completion.; Notes:  1. One possible approach is to perform a near max set of push-ups,  go on to the pull-ups, do the same with the sit-ups, etc. After the squats,  go back to the push-ups and run through the list again finishing as much  as you can at each exercise.  2.
